# runesSelector
create League of Legends rune pages on the fly in champ select

will quickly select runes during champ select from a preloaded build or from a mobafire link

use notes:
league client needs to be running on your primary monitor
league client interface needs to be running in 1600x900 
need a rune page slot in the 6th slot as this is where the clicker will open.

the selector is blind kill the terminal if its off target or just just make sure theres nothing in the middle of your screen thats where it will mostly click
not responsible if this clicks on anything it shouldn't use at your own risk
